# Codebase Summary: repo-map

## Key Components and Their Interactions:

- **`repo_map.py`**: The main script, orchestrating the entire process. Successfully refactored to use modular components. Handles CLI arguments and coordinates the analysis flow.
- **`file_processing.py`**: Handles file system operations, parsing, and code analysis. Tested and working for Python files. Successfully processes directory structures and respects .gitignore patterns.
- **`llm_interaction.py`**: Manages interactions with the OpenRouter LLM API. Core functionality tested. Gracefully handles missing API keys and failed responses.
- **`cache_management.py`**: Handles loading and updating the SQLite cache. Functionality fully verified with proper connection handling and data persistence.
- **`output_generation.py`**: Generates the final repository map output. Tree structure generation working with proper formatting and metadata inclusion.

The data flow is as follows: `repo_map.py` calls `file_processing.py` to analyze files. If descriptions are needed, it calls `llm_interaction.py`. The results are cached using `cache_management.py`. Finally, `output_generation.py` creates the output.

## Data Flow:

1. The main script (`repo_map.py`) walks the repository directory - ✓ Working
   - Properly traverses directory structure
   - Respects .gitignore patterns
   - Handles nested directories correctly

2. For each file, it computes a hash and checks the cache (`cache_management.py`) - ✓ Working
   - Fast hash computation
   - Efficient cache lookups
   - Proper connection management

3. File processing (`file_processing.py`) analyzes files - ✓ Working
   - Successfully extracts Python code structure
   - Identifies file types correctly
   - Handles various file encodings

4. LLM integration (`llm_interaction.py`) for descriptions - ✓ Core functionality tested
   - Graceful handling of missing API keys
   - Proper error reporting
   - Cache integration working

5. Results are saved to the cache - ✓ Functionality verified
   - Proper data serialization
   - Transaction handling
   - Constraint management

6. Output generation (`output_generation.py`) creates final output - ✓ Working
   - Clean tree structure formatting
   - Proper metadata inclusion
   - Efficient file writing
